/**
 * Sea-basin classification for tide stations.
 *
 * The only basin we need to distinguish for chart-datum purposes is the
 * Baltic/Kattegat MSL region: the Baltic's riparian states chart to a
 * mean-sea-level datum (BSCD2000) rather than a low-water datum, and Denmark
 * charts all inner Danish waters — the whole Kattegat included — to DVR90 ≈
 * MSL. The LAT regime starts in the Skagerrak/North Sea. This splits Germany's
 * North Sea coast (Seekartennull ≈ LAT) from its Baltic coast (MSL), and
 * Denmark's North Sea coast from its inner waters, which neither administrative
 * region nor a longitude line can do.
 *
 * Geometry: authoritative IHO Sea Areas (S-23) polygons from Marine Regions
 * (Flanders Marine Institute, CC-BY 4.0) — the Baltic Sea, Gulfs of Bothnia /
 * Finland / Riga, and the Kattegat; the Skagerrak is excluded. Outer rings
 * only (island gauges classify by basin) at ~1 km simplification; regenerate
 * with `node tools/fetch-sea-regions.ts`.
 *
 * A small tolerance treats points within ~2 km of a basin boundary as inside:
 * harbor gauges sit exactly on the (simplified) coastline, and it also closes
 * any seam sliver where two basins abut (e.g. Kattegat/Baltic at Öresund).
