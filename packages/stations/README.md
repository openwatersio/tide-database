# Station tooling

## Build and validate the unified catalogue

Station corrections and identities live in `metadata/corrections.yaml` and `metadata/registry.yaml` at the repo root. Use corrections for an existing provider record and the registry for curated records that may not exist in an imported source. `metadata/places.json` is the reviewed GeoNames snapshot used for deterministic location enrichment; builds do not download mutable gazetteer data. `metadata/water-bodies.geojson` (OpenStreetMap bays and straits) supplies a station's derived `context`, and `metadata/maritime-zones.geojson` (Marine Regions EEZs) supplies a registry record's country. Both are reviewed snapshots too; refresh them with `npm run fetch-water-bodies -w packages/stations` and `npm run fetch-maritime-zones -w packages/stations`, then review the context and country changes before committing. See `metadata/PROVENANCE.md` for sources and licenses.

Slug allocations, former paths, and position audits are durable release state. Do not edit their JSON lock files by hand. After changing source or curated metadata, run from the repo root:

```shell
npm run generate -w packages/database
npm run validate:database
npm test
```

If validation reports an intentional slug, route, coastline, or position change, inspect every id it reports, then update all locks together:

```shell
npm run metadata:lock
npm run validate:database
```

The updater refuses to discard a published route unless the station departed or the old path is retained as a redirect. Country codes are mandatory; locality and region codes may remain absent when there is no reliable value.
