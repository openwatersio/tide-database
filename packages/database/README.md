# @neaps/tide-database

> A public database of tide harmonics

Harmonic constituents, tidal datums, and station metadata for thousands of tide stations around the world. Feed the constituents to a tide harmonic calculator like [Neaps](https://github.com/openwatersio/neaps) to produce astronomical tide predictions.

Station data is curated in the [tide-database repository](https://github.com/openwatersio/tide-database), which documents [where each station comes from](https://github.com/openwatersio/tide-database#sources) and how it is quality-checked.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install @neaps/tide-database
```

## Usage

The package exports every tide and current station that passes the database's quality gates:

```typescript
import { stations, stationsById } from "@neaps/tide-database";

console.log("Total stations:", stations.length);
console.log(stationsById.get("noaa/9447130"));
```

`stations` leaves out records the quality evaluation rejected, such as duplicate gauges and implausible datums. `allStations` is the unfiltered catalog, `stationsById` maps an id to its station, and every search function below takes `includeAll: true` to search the full catalog instead of the accepted subset.

Each station carries its identity and location eagerly. The heavy prediction fields — `harmonic_constituents`, `datums`, and `epoch` — are decoded from the database file on first access, so importing the module does not pull every station's prediction data onto the heap. [See the format documentation](https://github.com/openwatersio/tide-database/blob/main/docs/database-format.md) for how that works.

Each station has separate `locality`, `region`, and `country` display fields. `country_code` is an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code; `region_code`, when available, is an ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. Consumers can therefore omit country or region text when the surrounding page already supplies it.

### Stable station routes

```typescript
import { stationRouteBySlug, stationsById } from "@neaps/tide-database";

const route = stationRouteBySlug("tide", "victoria");
const station = route && stationsById.get(route.stationIds[0]!);
console.log(station?.locality, station?.region, station?.country_code);
```

`stationRouteBySlug(kind, slug)` performs a binary lookup without decoding the full route index. `stationRoutes(kind)` decodes that kind's complete route list on demand. Prediction fields such as constituents and datums remain lazy.

### Searching for stations

#### Geographic search

`near` returns an array of `[station, distanceInKm]` tuples, closest first:

```typescript
import { near, nearest } from "@neaps/tide-database";

// Find stations within 10 km of a lat/lon
const nearbyStations = near({
  lon: -122,
  lat: 37,
  maxDistance: 10,
  maxResults: 50,
});
console.log("Nearby stations:", nearbyStations.length);
```

`nearest` returns a single `[station, distanceInKm]` tuple, or `null` when nothing matches:

```typescript
const result = nearest({ longitude: -75.5, latitude: 22 });
if (result) {
  const [station, distance] = result;
  console.log("Nearest station:", station.name, "is", distance, "km away");
}
```

Both functions take the following parameters:

- `latitude` or `lat`: Latitude in decimal degrees.
- `longitude`, `lon`, or `lng`: Longitude in decimal degrees.
- `maxDistance`: Maximum distance in kilometers to search for stations (default: unlimited).
- `filter`: A function that takes a station and returns `true` to include it in results, or `false` to exclude it.
- `includeAll`: Search the full catalog rather than quality-accepted stations only (default: `false`).

`near` also takes:

- `maxResults`: Maximum number of results to return (default: `10`).

#### Bounding box search

`bbox` takes a `[minLon, minLat, maxLon, maxLat]` tuple and returns the stations inside it:

```typescript
import { bbox } from "@neaps/tide-database";

// Find stations in the Boston area
const bostonStations = bbox([-71.5, 42, -70.5, 42.8]);
console.log("Stations in bounds:", bostonStations.length);

// With a filter
const referenceOnly = bbox([-72, 41, -70, 43], {
  filter: (station) => station.type === "reference",
});
```

The bounds are `minLon` (west edge), `minLat` (south edge), `maxLon` (east edge), and `maxLat` (north edge), in decimal degrees. The optional second argument takes:

- `filter`: A function that takes a station and returns `true` to include it in results, or `false` to exclude it.
- `includeAll`: Search the full catalog rather than quality-accepted stations only (default: `false`).

#### Full-text search

You can search for stations by name, region, country, or continent using the `search` function. It supports fuzzy matching and prefix search:

```typescript
import { search } from "@neaps/tide-database";

// Search for stations by name with fuzzy matching
const results = search("Boston");
console.log("Found:", results.length, "stations");
console.log(results[0].name);

// Search with a filter function
const usStations = search("harbor", {
  filter: (station) => station.country === "United States",
  maxResults: 10,
});
console.log("US harbor stations:", usStations);

// Combine multiple filters
const referenceStations = search("island", {
  filter: (station) =>
    station.type === "reference" && station.continent === "Americas",
  maxResults: 20,
});
console.log("Reference stations:", referenceStations);
```

The `search` function takes the following parameters:

- `query` (required): Search string. Supports fuzzy matching and prefix search.
- `options` (optional):
  - `filter`: Function that takes a station and returns `true` to include it in results, or `false` to exclude it.
  - `includeAll`: Search the full catalog rather than quality-accepted stations only (default: `false`).
  - `maxResults`: Maximum number of results to return (default: `20`).

## Station types

Stations are either _reference_ or _subordinate_, given by the station's `type` field.

Reference stations have their own `harmonic_constituents`, usually derived from a long record of real water level observations. Subordinate stations predict from a nearby reference station's harmonics, adjusted by four `offsets` — two correcting water level and two correcting the time of high and low tide. Reading a subordinate's `harmonic_constituents` or `datums` returns its reference station's values, so both types predict the same way.

The full field-by-field description lives in [`schemas/station.schema.json`](https://github.com/openwatersio/tide-database/blob/main/schemas/station.schema.json).

## The database file

The module reads a single [FlatBuffers](https://flatbuffers.dev) file built from [`schemas/database.fbs`](https://github.com/openwatersio/tide-database/blob/main/schemas/database.fbs). Every release of this package also attaches that file as `neaps-<date>.tcdb`, so native apps can bundle and memory-map it and generate a reader in their own language from the schema.
