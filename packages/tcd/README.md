# Neaps Tide Database - TCD (XTide Harmonics File)

This package generates a TCD (Tide Constituent Database) binary file of the Neaps Tide Database. The TCD file can be used with [XTide](https://flaterco.com/xtide/), [OpenCPN](https://opencpn.org), and any software that reads the [libtcd](https://flaterco.com/xtide/libtcd.html) format.

The TCD file includes all tide and current stations in the tide database, and all tidal constituents present in the station data, resolved through the constituent list from [@neaps/tide-predictor](https://github.com/openwatersio/neaps/tree/main/packages/tide-predictor#readme).

Current stations are named `<Name>, <Region> Current`, with the NOAA station id appended where several stations share a name (for example, different depths at one location). Speeds are in knots in both the metric and imperial files. A few stations can't be represented in the format and are left out: reference currents without harmonic constants, and subordinate currents with a speed ratio of zero, which libtcd would read as "no ratio".

## Usage

Download the latest `neaps-YYYYMMDD.tcd` from [releases](https://github.com/openwatersio/tide-database/releases).

### OpenCPN

Open the OpenCPN options, navigate to the "Charts" tab, and add the TCD file as a "Tides & Currents" data source. See the [OpenCPN manual](https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn%3Amanual_basic%3Aset_options%3Acharts%3Atides-currents) for more details.

### XTide

To use the TCD file with XTide, set the `HFILE_PATH` environment variable to point to the downloaded TCD file:

```sh
export HFILE_PATH=/path/to/neaps-*.tcd
```

Launch the XTide graphical interface:

```sh
xtide
```

#### Command-line usage

List all stations:

```sh
tide -m l
```

Search for stations by name (case-insensitive prefix match):

```sh
tide -m l | grep -i boston
```

Get tide predictions for a station:

```sh
tide -l "BOSTON, MA, United States"
```

Get current predictions (max flood, max ebb, and slack) for a current station:

```sh
tide -l "Pollock Rip Channel (butler Hole), Massachusetts Current"
```

Get predictions for a specific date range in CSV format:

```sh
tide -l "BOSTON, MA, United States" -b "2026-01-01 00:00" -e "2026-01-08 00:00" -f c -u m
```
